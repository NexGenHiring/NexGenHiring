# NexGenHiring

A very sophisticated yet simple hiring application that hires based on a person's skills, character, aim and hobbies! And not only it will check the best for the candidate but the best for the companies and teams as well with a characteristic profile for them too. Providing all types of hiring in a matter of time. And we do not want to limit it to only tech and management people, but also make it a platform viable for creators in all domains from art to science and from laborers to CEOs with a very optimized and innovative way to make that happen. A one stop solution for all those seeking to hire or outsource. It also would provide a marketing solution for every user who owns a social media account, which would in return help them earn money in the form of in app coins, which later can be redeemed in the app itself for actual stores out there.
It would also develop a new innovative hiring process that bridges the gap of different locations, skills and hobbies, personality, human character, age differences, work profile, job responsibilities etc. and solve a few issues HR and talent recruiters face about compatibility, practicality, job reach and hectic long hiring processes. Which would also prove helpful to candidates build trust around companies , verify the jobs they apply to and work in the domain they can be most productive in with ease.
